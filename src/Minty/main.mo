// 1) Organize file structure, actor, module, type, class,
//structure factorings as look most manageable / convenient
// starting point from various examples cited

// 2) Review, outline, verify overall interaction
// and processing flows.

// 3) Sketch out declarations and signatures of major components:
//     a) Managing accounts, principals, etc.
//     - id msg content for canister interaction, auth,
//       ownership, (witness?) etc.

//     b) NFT types factored into modules to import as needed
//         depending on applicable standard.  (DRC 721, )
//         DRC 721 recommended for use in project
            
//     c) Token content management - what does it contain, is it
//        extensible?

//     c) Core minting rountines - ideally polymorphic and/or
//       composable as where reuse and specialization across
//        standards can be maintained.

//     d) A minting_utils module with basic supplementary
//         routines tailored to requirements of main modules/operations

//     e) Incrementally deploy web frontend as needed

//     f) familiarize with packaging (vessel) and config - review
//       changes for incorporating new frameworks and toolchain

//Intermediate Additions:
// - Integrate a Token Transaction into the project
// - Add some kind of Token, Ownership or other relates listings

//Base imports
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";

//DIP 721 Types
module {
  public type TokenAddress = Principal;
  public type TokenId = Nat;
};

// Define the Token Structure




// Define the Transactions on Tokens
